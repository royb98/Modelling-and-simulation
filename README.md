Evolution.py runs a simulation of an ecosystem where each animal is modeled separately. Each animal is essentially described by its location and genome.

The code is quite straightforward. The parameters that can be modified are at the top of the code. The behaviour of the animals is encoded in the class definitions. The initial genomes of the animals are below the class definitions. The plotting is done at the end.
