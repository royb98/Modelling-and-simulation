# evolution.py runs a simulation of an ecosystem where each animal is modeled separately
# each animal is essentially described by its location and genome, plus 

# the code is quite straightforward:
#   the parameters that can be modified are at the top of the code
#   the behaviour of the animals is encoded in the class definitions
#   the initial genomes of the animals are below the class definitions
#   the plotting is done at the end
